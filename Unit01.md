**Unit 1: Introduction to Algorithms** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit introduces what algorithms are and discusses their importance
with the role that algorithms play compared to other technologies used
in computers.  We look into description of algorithms using pseudo-code
and we use pseudo-code for algorithmic analysis.  We will go through an
introduction of algorithms using examples of sorting algorithms while
discussing the importance of algorithm analysis in that context. *

     Instructions: Please complete all questions in this
    assessment. <span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>There are
    three questions on finding the complexity of the algorithm using the
    pseudo code and finding the number of instructions executed to solve
    the problem. <span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>Each
    instruction is associated with some constant cost for execution. You
    can check your answers with the Saylor Foundation’s [“Answer
