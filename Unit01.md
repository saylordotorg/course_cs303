**Unit 1: Introduction to Algorithms** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit introduces what algorithms are and discusses their importance
with the role that algorithms play compared to other technologies used
in computers.  We look into description of algorithms using pseudo-code
and we use pseudo-code for algorithmic analysis.  We will go through an
introduction of algorithms using examples of sorting algorithms while
discussing the importance of algorithm analysis in that context. *
