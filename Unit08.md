**Unit 8: NP-Completeness** <span id="8"></span> 
*In this last unit, we will study a special class of problems called the
NP-complete problems.  Many interesting computational problems are
NP-complete, but there are no polynomial-time algorithms known for
solving any of them.  The unit presents techniques for determining when
a problem is NP-complete. *
