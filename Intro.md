Course Syllabus for "CS303: Algorithms"
---------------------------------------

This course focuses on the fundamentals of computer algorithms,
emphasizing methods useful in practice. We look into the algorithm
analysis as a way to understand behavior of computer programs as a
function of its input size. Using the big-O notation, we classify
algorithms by their efficiency. We look into basic algorithm strategies
and approaches to problem solving. Some of these approaches include the
divide and conquer method, dynamic programming, and greedy programming
paradigms. Sorting and searching algorithms are discussed in detail as
they form part of a solution to a large number of problems solved using
computers. We also provide an introduction to the graph theory and graph
algorithms as they are also used in many computer-based applications
today. We conclude the course with a look into a special class of
problems called the NP-complete problems.
