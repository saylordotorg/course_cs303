**Unit 2: Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we explore how we can express an algorithm’s efficiency
as a function of its input size.  The order of growth of running time of
an algorithm gives a simple characterization of algorithm’s efficiency
and allows us to relate performance of alternative algorithms.
 Asymptotic analysis is based on the idea that as the problem size
grows, the complexity will eventually settle down to a simple
proportionality to some known function.  This idea is incorporated in
the \`\`Big Oh,'' \`\`Big Omega,'' and \`\`Big Theta'' notations for
asymptotic performance.  These notations are useful for expressing the
complexity of an algorithm without getting lost in unnecessary detail.*
