**Unit 4: Sorting Algorithms** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit introduces algorithms that sort real numbers.  Algorithms
often use sorting as a key subroutine.  There is a wide variety of
sorting algorithms, and they use a rich set of techniques.  These
algorithms have different runtime complexities and work better in
certain conditions.  Some of algorithms that we will study include Quick
Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Merge Sort. *

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please complete all questions in this assessment. 
    There are two questions on the sorting algorithms.  The first one
    involves the merge-sort algorithm and requires you to work through
    the merging part of the algorithm.  The second one then asks you to
    implement the merging work that you just completed in the first
    problem.  You can check your answers with the Saylor Foundation’s
    “[Answer
    Key](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CS303-Unit4AssignmentAnswerKey-FINAL.pdf)”
    (PDF).  
        
     This assessment should take you approximately 3 hours to complete,
    including reviews for preparation.
