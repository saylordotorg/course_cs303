**Unit 7: Greedy Algorithms** <span id="7"></span> 
*In this unit, we will look into a common computer science algorithm
technique called the greedy algorithms.  Like the dynamic programming
paradigm, greedy algorithms typically apply to optimization problems in
which a set of choices must be made in order to arrive at an optimal
solution.  The idea of greedy algorithm is to make each choice in a
locally optimal manner.  We will explore some common greedy algorithms
in use today as a way of explaining the topic in this unit. *
