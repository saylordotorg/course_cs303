**Unit 6: Graph Theory and Graph Algorithms** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about graph theory and graph-based
algorithms.  Graphs are a pervasive data structure in computer science
and algorithms working with them are fundamental to the subject.  We
will review basic concepts of graph and associated terminology.  We will
also see how we can represent graphs in computer algorithms and use
these representations to solve some common problems, such as finding the
shortest paths between any two places.  You will also get an
introduction to trees and a minimum weight spanning tree algorithm. *
