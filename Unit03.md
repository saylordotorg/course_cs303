**Unit 3: Divide and Conquer Method** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we will examine a popular technique called
divide-and-conquer that is used in solving computer science problems.
 This technique solves the problem by breaking up the problem into
smaller problems of same type and then recursively solving these smaller
problems and combining their answers.  We will also look into analysis
of these algorithms through the use of recursion techniques. *
