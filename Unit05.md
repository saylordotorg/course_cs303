**Unit 5: Dynamic Programming** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, we will study another popular computer science
algorithmic paradigm called the dynamic programming.  Dynamic
programming, like the divide-and-conquer method, solves problem by
combining solutions to sub-problems.  Dynamic programming typically
applies to optimization problems in which a set of choices must be made
in order to arrive at an optimal solution.  It is effective when a given
sub-problem may arise from more than one partial set of choices.  We
will look into problems, such as the longest common subsequence and the
knapsack problem, to explain the key ideas behind dynamic programming. *

     Instructions: Please complete all questions in this activity.
     There is one question on the dynamic-programming paradigm that
    requires two implementations.  The first one involves the use of the
    regular approach to matrix multiplication, and the second one
    requires the dynamic programming approach.  You have to compare the
    runtimes for the two approaches.  You can check your answers with
    the Saylor Foundation’s “[Guide to
    Responding.](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CS303-Unit5Dynamic-ProgrammingAnswerKey-FINAL.pdf)”

     This activity should take you approximately 10 hours to complete,
    including reviews for preparation.
